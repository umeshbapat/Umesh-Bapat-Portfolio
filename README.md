A strong technical, results driven leader with proven record of working on high value products in different domains through hiring, building and growing team members.  

## How do I lead?
* I try and always like to lead from the front and as example. 
* I strongly believe that a leader should not expect anything from the team that one can not follow in his own life - that's character. 
* I believe in empowerment instead of delegation. 
* I believe in building a team of leaders, drivers who work with clarity, passion and commitment. 
* I believe in a culture of innovation and a place where experiments and failures are welcomed. 
* I believe in keeping it light, healthy and extremely transparent.

Along with that, here is how I have done with our core leadership principles.

### Thinking Strategically
  * Have demonstrated ability to take on new teams and shape them into high performing well known teams. Proven track of cloud enablement at multiple places such as Servicing, RocketPro, Origination, Appraisal Tech
  * Came up with a benchmark of usage of PRs, comments for coaching and helping performance evaluation  
    * Identified the need to standardize the PR process across the teams
    * Identified the need of a solution to get this data
    * Hands on developed a tool which can help with this problem
    * Not only developed but then made it shareable with other team leaders who have been continuously using it
  * Identified a need of having a tool and lead the development of a tool like appFactory which saves hours of work for engineers
    * I am a big believer in developing solutions for ourselvesto make our life easy and this was another eample of it
  * Lead the engineer hiring process at multiple teams to grow the teams strategically
    * Owned the method
    * Worked with vendor teams to clarify the expectations
    * Tweaked the process when needed - one round vs two rounds, pausing the hiring
 * Have been a vocal presence in architecture development in appraisal and all my previous teams
### Achieving Results
Some noteworthy big releases to name here which describes impact made on the outcome.
  *  Property analytics and Starter Mismo in quantum 
      * This was first ever set of cloud services in appraisal tech teams and it went through a ton of design, brainstorming and efforts to get launched. Under my leadership the team not only established this achievement but also established themselves as a crucial cogg in appraisal space. It was noteworthy because entire team inclusing me was new to the group and space.

  * NOVA all appraisal go live
    * Appraisal became the first ever team to be live with a business team pilot and subsequently entire team structure went live with multiple workspaces.

  * MAC.ai aka Amrock assist

* Machine learning usage througha  microservice
    * Identified a need of this service to solve the need of efficiency in the process by which we can reduce the mundane tasks APS team has to work through.

    * appFActory was a fantastic demonstration of how a team can be inspired to take on a project on the side through hack weeks, through the opportunities while delivering features to roll an app wide which is flocusing on innovation, efficiency and engineers!

* Appraisal Admin Tool 
    * Another tool which was identified by our day to day supporting needs whch takes away a ton of time if have to do all manual. An inspired idea and team can change the day of tech team members who put in hard yards to support our business the best way.


### Driving the Culture
  * **Team Time** to help the team know each other better! - this monthly activity has helped team come closer to each other and know the different backgrounds we come from. This helps to see us beyond professionals. Team has vocally appreciative of it and how it helped bring all of us closer.

  * Empathy and understanding of the humans
    * My conversation and dialogue with TRS Gloria Raines helped create clarity on what an immigrant goes through in day to day complexities with immigration policies and law changes. What are the impacts of it on their personal lives. I highlighted the need of raising awareness for it in leadership community and which became a hugely successful event.
