A strong technical, results driven leader with proven record of working on high value products in different domains through hiring, building and growing team members.  

## How do I lead?
* I try and always like to lead from the front and as example. 
* I strongly believe that a leader should not expect anything from the team that one can not follow in his own life - that's character. 
* I believe in empowerment instead of delegation. 
* I believe in building a team of leaders, drivers who work with clarity, passion and commitment. 
* I believe in a culture of innovation and a place where experiments and failures are welcomed. 
* I believe in keeping it light, healthy and extremely transparent.

Along with that, here is how I have done with our core leadership principles.

### Thinking Strategically
  * In servicing took on the challenge of cloud enablement and planned the moves to be the first team to deploy a cloud application in entire servicing - took a strategic goal and delivered it
  * Owned the OKR tactic for consistency in PR process 
    * Identified the need to standardize the PR process across the teams
    * Pulled the top engineers and bought them into the idea of PR templates and set the practice for all repos  
  * Identified the need of centralized status management service or app when understood the production noise with RP
  * Lead the contractor hiring process in RP to continue growing the teams strategically
    * Owned the method
    * Worked with vendor teams to clarify the expectations
    * Tweaked the process when needed - one round vs two rounds, pausing the hiring
