A results-driven technical leader with a proven track record of delivering high-value products across diverse business domains. Passionate about hiring, building, and growing high-performing teams that drive innovation and impact.  
## 👨‍💻 About Me
With 19 years in the software engineering industry and variety of domains and geography, I bring over 10 years of hands-on leadership, where I've led teams to successfully execute and deliver impactful solutions. About 10 years ago I joined Rocket family of companies as a contractor and in a matter of a years time I was offered a leader's job, since then I’ve continued to foster high-performance cultures and lead teams to innovative results 🚀, always with an emphasis on long-term success and team empowerment 💡

## 🌟 My Leadership Philosophy  
- 🔥 Lead by example—never expect what I wouldn’t do myself.  
- 🚀 Empower rather than delegate; build leaders, not followers.  
- 💡 Foster a culture of innovation where experimentation and failure are embraced.  
- 🎯 Maintain clarity, passion, commitment, and transparency within teams.  
- 🌱 Keep the work environment light, healthy, and inspiring.  

## 🧠 Strategic Thinking 
- **Transforming Teams:** Built high-performing teams, driving cloud enablement in **Servicing, RocketPro, Origination, and Appraisal Tech.**  
- **AI/ML-Driven Efficiency:** Implemented AI based appraisal workflows, leveraging ML for faster, smarter decision-making. Will result in **20% reduction** in manual tasks for APS.  
- **Architectural Reform:** Played an influential leader/architect role in monolith-to-microservices transition and architectural reforms, enhancing scalability and resilience. 40% reduction in support tickets at one place. **Improved support tickets inflow by 50%**   
- **Developer Experience:** Scaled internal tooling (e.g., **appFactory**, **appraisal admin**) to streamline workflows and boost productivity. This **gets rid of 100% manual efforts** for developer to establish a new API in prod.  
- **Performance Management:** Built a PR reporting tool from scratch, made it scalable, multiple leaders adopted it for coaching and performance review in FOC.  
- **Process Innovation:** Shifted teams from rigid sprints to milestone-driven delivery.

- **Strategic Hiring:** Optimized hiring pipelines, refining vendor collaborations and interview processes. Hired a new team of developers to grow the train size by 10% headcount.
