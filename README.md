## 👨‍💻 About Me
With 19 years in the software engineering industry and variety of domains and geography, I bring over 10 years of hands-on leadership, where I've led teams to successfully execute and deliver impactful solutions.

- 🎯 Maintain clarity, passion, commitment, and transparency within teams.  
- 🌱 Keep the work environment light, healthy, and inspiring.
